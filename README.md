## Premise

We originally had three ideas - an app that recorded peopleâ€™s stories and experiences; an app that enabled people in Sacramento to engage and participate in events; and an app that organized multiple social media channels privately. After consulting with Jordan and Treighton, we filtered and refined our ideas into an app that would encourage a close-knit community in Sacramento by allowing users and businesses to share their upcoming events and experiences only local to the city of Sacramento.

## Technologies

This full-stack app includes:

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize.js, Handlebars.js, routing, servers, MVC paradigm, CRUD

Deployed using Heroku

Version control using Git Bash

## THE PROGRESS LOG

### Saturday, May 5, 2018

1) Celebrated Cinco de Mayo by indulging in margaritas during our lunch hour :)
2) Pulled all files that Jeff set up, including HTML template for website, routing, database, CSS
3) Brainstormed ideas, discussed how we would incorporate CRUD and MySQL, discussed with Nelly, Jordan, and Treighton about how to execute and combine ideas, browsed examples of local-events-styled apps from Sacramento and Austin, TX
4) Discussed differences between paid vs. free version, public vs. private version.

### Tuesday, May 8, 2018

1) Received guidance from Nelly in making the user's saved events the same as the events shown on the events page
2) Troubleshooted through files we couldn't find, databases and tables we couldn't make, repos we couldn't pull, and branches that couldn't work (it's OK, we dealt with it all)
3) Decided on making three databases - users, user's favorites, events
4) Switched to making 3 tables instead of 3 databases to avoid the many connections we would need to make
5) Got web-scraping advice from Jordan and using Cheerio.js if Sac365 didn't have an API of its own
